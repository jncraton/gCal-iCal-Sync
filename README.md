# gCal-iCal-Sync

Syncs a public iCal URL to a Google Calendar. On each run, this program will add events to a Google calendar from an iCal (.ics) provided as a URL. This can optionally remove all events from the calendar not found in the iCal file to create a Google calendar that is an exact copy of another available calendar.

See config.example.py for an example configuration.
